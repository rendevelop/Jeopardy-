Jeopardy++

This Jeopardy Project works with Visual Studio 2015 with the v140 build tools.

Features:
Loads questions from OpenTBD.
If no internet connection, loads default questions.
Saves profile.
Makes use of .NET's user controls to navigate among different pages or sections.

Dependencies:
cpp-base64 (https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/cpp-base64)
opentbd api (https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)
json (https://github.com/nlohmann/json)

Future Features:
In the future I would like to organize the questions into categories.
Also an interface where the user would be able to choose which categories
and the number of questions would be practical.

Thank you for assigning this project. If I make any other updates I will let you know.
